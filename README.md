Welcome!

The lab I have created here is a fully integrated SOAR solution incorporating Wazuh & TheHive for case management. While I have created Wazuh and Hive on cloud, I have also utilized other tools such as Sysmon to help integrate the logs from windows client to Wazuh. 
Further Shuffle makes the ends meet by connecting Wazuh to the hive and also send emails to the client if an alert was detected followed by a response setup.
